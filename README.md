# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn Prediction on Banking Data using Neural Network

Project Overview:

Customer churn prediction is a critical use case in banking and subscription-based businesses.
By analyzing customer demographics, account details, and activity, we can predict churn probability and take proactive actions.

This model is about:

Preprocesses raw data and encodes categorical features.

Standardizes numerical variables.

Trains a deep learning classifier using ANN.

Evaluates model performance using accuracy and validation loss curves.
